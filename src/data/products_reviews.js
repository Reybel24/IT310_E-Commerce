After putting this suit on for the first time, it immediatly ripped.I know i'm kind of on the heavier side of the scale, however, this product is advertised to be made from the strongest cloth. I definitely will NOT be buying from this company again. Terrible. I'd give it 0 stars if I could. To anyone considering buying, STAY AWAY!!!",
